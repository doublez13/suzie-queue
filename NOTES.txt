~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NOTES/TODO ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-Admins, unless they are also members of their TA groups, will NOT have access to many endpoints. Should we modify the TA endpoints to also allow admins? The problem is, we probably don't want to give admins access to all courses, only their own. Therefore, instead of one admin group (queue-admin-GROUP), should there be one for each course?
-Some endpoints, for example in stats, return username where full_name might be more useful.
-The photo on the about page doesn't work well with mobile screens or screen resizing
-In Edge on the queue page I noticed this error every ~20 seconds, but no visible issue: "SCRIPT12030: SCRIPT12030: WebSocket Error: Network Error 12030, The connection with the server was terminated abnormally"
-The alert() in the fail function in queue_functions.js prints 'undefined' instead of the error.
-Small UI issue in Chrome and Firefox: the rows don't render across the entire queue table in the student view.
-Small UI issue in Edge: when announcements word wrap and the last line has only a small amount of text, only the announcement column is fully highlighted.
-Small UI issue in mobile Safari: in the TA view the Course Stats button is not same width as the button group above.
-TA log to track how long on duty?
-Should we add "authenticated => ... " to invalid_method() in errors.php? This would require a dynamic check.
-Make questions optionally visible to rest of class?
-Can a course be taught by two different professors during the same semester? DB won't allow that.
-help_student.php (not the UI) allows two TAs to help the same student. How would we show this using colors.
-Have different background colors for TAs?
-Have CIS handle authentication?
-Should logging out remove you from all queues?
-Lock navbar in place when scrolling?
-Include a utility for TAs to directly message students currently in the queue (collectively or individually). This can be useful if a student's location is incorrect, or to warn that TA hours are ending soon.
-Include push notifications to the TAs on duty for when a student enters the queue.  During slow times, when the queue is empty, some TAs are late noticing that a student has entered.
-Undo removing a student.
