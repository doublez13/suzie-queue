~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NOTES/TODO ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-Admins, unless they are also members of their TA groups, will NOT have access to many endpoints. Should we modify the TA endpoints to also allow admins? The problem is, we probably don't want to give admins access to all courses, only their own. Therefore, instead of one admin group (queue-admin-GROUP), should there be one for each course?
-In Edge on the queue page I noticed this error every ~20 seconds, but no visible issue: "SCRIPT12030: SCRIPT12030: WebSocket Error: Network Error 12030, The connection with the server was terminated abnormally"
-Do we need an API endpoint for 'is_user_admin'? We check this with embedded php, but how would an independent interface check this? Maybe add this to get_info.php?
-The alert() in the fail function in queue_functions.js prints 'undefined' instead of the error.
-Modify stats endpoints to let user post date ranges so such massive amounts of data aren't returned?
-Should we have the UI show specifically which TA is helping whom? Maybe each TA can have its own color in the TAs on Duty box.
-It took up more room, but I think the TA name could be useful for announcements.
-Small UI issue in Edge: when announcements word wrap and the last line has only a small amount of text, only the announcement column is fully highlighted.
-TA log to track how long on duty?
-Should we add "authenticated => ... " to invalid_method() in errors.php? This would require a dynamic check.
-Make questions optionally visible to rest of class?
-Make 'description' optional for courses? What did we want to use this for?
-Can a course be taught by two different professors during the same semester? DB won't allow that.
-Some numerical values are returned as strings (e.g. 'time_lim' and 'id' in get_queue.php). Would it make more sense to make these integers?
-Should we have a link on the login page to some CADE page if users don't have a CADE account?
-help_student.php (not the UI) allows two TAs to help the same student. How would we show this using colors.
-Have different background colors for TAs
-Have CIS handle authentication
-Should logging out remove you from all queues?
-Lock navbar in place when scrolling
-Include a utility for TAs to directly message students currently in the queue (collectively or individually). This can be useful if a student's location is incorrect, or to warn that TA hours are ending soon.
-Include push notifications to the TAs on duty for when a student enters the queue.  During slow times, when the queue is empty, some TAs are late noticing that a student has entered.
-Undo removing a student.
