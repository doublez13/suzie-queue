~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NOTES/TODO ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-The photo on the about page doesn't work well with mobile screens or screen resizing
-In Edge on the queue page I noticed this error every ~20 seconds, but no visible issue: "SCRIPT12030: SCRIPT12030: WebSocket Error: Network Error 12030, The connection with the server was terminated abnormally"
-Small UI issue in Edge: when announcements word wrap and the last line has only a small amount of text, only the announcement column is fully highlighted.
-Small UI issue in mobile Safari: in the TA view the Course Stats button is not same width as the button group above.
-TA log to track how long on duty?
-Should we add "authenticated => ... " to invalid_method() in errors.php? This would require a dynamic check.
-Make questions optionally visible to rest of class?
-Can a course be taught by two different professors during the same semester? DB won't allow that.
-Have different background colors for TAs?
-Have CIS handle authentication?
-Should logging out remove you from all queues?
-Lock navbar in place when scrolling?
-Include a utility for TAs to directly message students currently in the queue (collectively or individually). This can be useful if a student's location is incorrect, or to warn that TA hours are ending soon.
-Include push notifications to the TAs on duty for when a student enters the queue.  During slow times, when the queue is empty, some TAs are late noticing that a student has entered.
-Undo removing a student.
